This is a repository full of random projects or ideas that I work on in C++. Here's a short description of the files you can find in here.

- *FourVector.cpp*: A custom class to do operations on the [four-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector) mathematical object in Einstein's Relativity. Includes boosts, dual vectors, and other vector operations. 
- *vigenere.cpp*: A script that allows you to encrypt a message using the [Vigènere Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher). Includes encryption and decryption.

Have fun and enjoy!
