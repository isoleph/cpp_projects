This is a repository full of random projects or ideas that I work on in C++. Here's a short description of the files you can find in the folders above.

**FourVector.cpp**: A custom class to do operations on the [four-vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-vector) mathematical object in Einstein's Relativity. Includes boosts, dual vectors, and other vector operations.

**RK4.cpp** : A script that uses the [Runge-Kutta Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta_methods) to solve ordinary differential equations. I also wrote `rk4_analysis.py` to compare the RK4 solution to the actual solution. In this folder, I've also included RK42D which solves second order ODES the same way, as well as a function to calculate derivatives at a point with `derivatives.cpp`.
